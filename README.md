# battleOfWits
A simple turn-based battle game written in JavaScript, where two players face off each other using their roster of three chosen words. This is done using the JavaScript concept of string value, where each character has an associated ASCII content.
Therefore, longer words that use letters later in the alphabet are more likely to win. Players also have the choice to swap out words if one were to get close to being deleted.
